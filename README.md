# Pneumatic
A small console-based tool to download MP3 / MP4 files from the internet in the highest quality possible.

**REQUIRES PYTHON 3.7 OR HIGHER**

It is:
- Basically a really simple wrapping of [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md) into a Python console application.
- A program that works best with YouTube and SoundCloud.
- Not perfect, and will not be updated to fix any bugs or anything. It was for fun, and certainly not a serious project that I can continually invest time into (I'd rather do so once I've learnt how to do this but as a proper program with a GUI).
