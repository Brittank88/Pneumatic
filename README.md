# Pneumatic
A small console-based tool to download MP3 / MP4 files from the internet in the highest quality possible.

It is...

- Basically a really simple wrapping of [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md) into a Python console application.
- Works best with YouTube and SoundCloud.
- Is not perfect, and will not be updated to fix any bugs or anything.
